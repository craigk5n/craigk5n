### Hi there

I am a software engineer, and I've been contributing to open source projects for 20+ years.  My open
source repositories include:
- [CVE services](https://github.com/craigk5n/cve-services): I've contributed to the (new in 2021) REST API
  for MITRE's CVE project.  My [primary contributions](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/pulls?q=author%3Acraigk5n)
  have related to containerizing the NodeJS app.
- [WebCalendar](https://github.com/craigk5n/webcalendar): PHP LAMP multi-user calendar with translations to over 25 languages and long history of support.
  I have had many code contributions to WebCalendar over the years and can only claim to have authored about have the code.
  There are also over [25 translations](https://github.com/craigk5n/webcalendar/tree/master/translations).
- [Java Calendar Tools](https://github.com/craigk5n/javacaltools): Java library for parsing and generating
  iCalendar ([RFC 2445](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2445.html)) data
- [k5nCal](https://github.com/craigk5n/k5ncal): Desktop calendar application written in Java
- [GTimer](https://github.com/craigk5n/gtimer): Linux GTK application for timing how much time you spend on various projects
- [Ilib](https://github.com/craigk5n/ilib): C library for reading, writing, and manipulating images with API loosely
  based on [X11 API](https://x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html) and utilizing any
  [X11 BDF font](https://x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/fonts/fonts.html) for writing text

I'm currently working on:
- Updating WebCalendar's UI to use Bootstrap and jQuery.  It was previously using some very old custom HTML/CSS
  and a mix of JS tools (Prototype.js and others).  The work for this is in the bootstrap-ui branch, but I
  am hoping to merge it into the main branch soon.
- Teaching myself Go.  I recently posted my first Go code on Github with my new [cliquetool](https://github.com/craigk5n/cliquetool)
  project.  The project deals with 
  [cliques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem) in
  a sparsely populated undirected graph based on some work I did years ago in C.
  My example data set includes be a list of NCAA basketball games from a single season.
  The goal was to determine the conference affiliations for all teams based on
  the list of games.  (Note that in college basketball, each team within a conference generally plays
  each other team at least once.  This is not true in college football where teams often play a
  subset of the other teams within their conference.)

Interesting facts:
- My first open source contribution was a system menubar for HP-UX, SunOS, AIX and OSF/1 that I released
  in 1995 called xapplaunch (still online [here](https://distro.ibiblio.org/amigolinux/download/XApps/xapplaunch-1.1afx/)) by placing the source code on a public FTP server.
  Note that the term "open source" was not actually established until
  [a few years later in 1998](https://opensource.org/faq).
